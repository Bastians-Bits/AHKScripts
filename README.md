# AHKScripts
Collection of my AutoHotKey- Scripts

# What is this about
This repository contains the ahk scripts I use in my day-to-day life.

# G13.ahk
I had an old Logitech G13 collecting dust in a corner and wanted to use it for something. the script uses ahkhid to intercept the key events and send own key strokes. Has the advantage, that the g13's keys don't have to map to a real key.

## Set Up
To set the script up, get your G13 device infos (for example, with AHKHID example1) and edit all occurences with EDIT HERE. Everything else should be working out of the box.
